## Introduction

The project aims to create an interactive website for visualizing data.
The site allows users to navigate through the data and explore various aspects of the subject using interactive graphs.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the "Summer Olympics Medals" dataset on Kaggle.

It is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/summer-olympics-medals, providing information on medalists from the Summer Olympics between 1976 and 2008. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned in Python before being used for the website.

## Libraries Used

The website utilizes the following libraries:

- D3.js: for creating interactive graphs
- DC.js: for creating interactive dashboards
- Crossfilter: for data aggregation and manipulation

## Website Functionality

The website allows users to visualize data through different interactive graphs. The graphs can be filtered and sorted using dropdown menus and sliders to explore various aspects of the data.
The website also offers interactive dashboards that allow users to view the data in the form of tables, charts, and maps.
The dashboards can be customized to meet the user's needs.

To use the website, the user simply needs to navigate the site and click on the graphs to filter the results based on certain dimensions (country, medal type, etc.). The graphs and dashboards update in real-time based on the user's selections.

## Installation and Execution

All the libraries are stored locally within the project files.
To run the website, Flask needs to be installed on the computer, and you need to execute "python app.py" in the "Summer Olympics Medals" directory.
